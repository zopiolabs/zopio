# AUTOMATED RELEASE WORKFLOW
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Purpose: Automates the versioning, changelog generation, and package publishing
#          process when changes are merged to the main branch.
#
# Triggers:
# - Push events to the main branch (typically from merged PRs)
#
# Key Features:
# - Semantic versioning based on conventional commits
# - Automated changelog generation
# - NPM package publishing
# - GitHub release creation
# - Skip release on [ci skip] or [skip ci] tags
#
# DX Benefits:
# - Eliminates manual release process
# - Ensures consistent versioning
# - Maintains accurate changelog history
# - Reduces human error in the release process
# - Provides immediate availability of new versions

name: Release Workflow

# The event that will trigger the action
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

# Workflow Jobs Configuration
jobs:
  # Main release job that handles versioning, changelog, and publishing
  release:
    # Using Ubuntu for its reliability and performance in CI environments
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Skip release process when commit messages contain 'ci skip' or 'skip ci'
    # This prevents infinite loops when auto-generated commits trigger the workflow
    # Also useful for documentation-only changes that don't need a release
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'ci skip') && !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci')"
    # Detailed steps for the release process
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      # This gets the latest code from the main branch
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Fetch complete git history for accurate versioning
      # Auto requires full history to determine the correct version bump
      # and to generate an accurate changelog
      - name: Prepare repository
        run: git fetch --unshallow --tags

      # Step 3: Set up Node.js environment
      # Using the latest LTS version for compatibility and performance
      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4

      # Step 4: Set up pnpm package manager
      # Using pnpm for faster, more efficient dependency management
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        name: Install pnpm
        with:
          run_install: false  # We'll install dependencies after caching

      # Step 5: Configure pnpm store path for caching
      # This improves build performance by reusing the pnpm store across runs
      - name: Get pnpm store directory
        shell: bash
        run: |
          echo "STORE_PATH=$(pnpm store path --silent)" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      # Step 6: Set up caching for pnpm dependencies
      # This significantly speeds up builds by reusing previously downloaded packages
      - uses: actions/cache@v4
        name: Setup pnpm cache
        with:
          path: ${{ env.STORE_PATH }}
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-

      # Step 7: Install all project dependencies
      # Using pnpm for efficient installation in the monorepo structure
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      # Step 8: Build the CLI package
      # This ensures the CLI is properly compiled before publishing
      # Using tsup for efficient TypeScript bundling
      - name: Build CLI
        run: npx tsup

      # Step 9: Create and publish the release
      # Uses Auto to determine version, update changelog, create GitHub release,
      # and publish to npm based on conventional commits
      - name: Create Release
        env:
          # GitHub token for creating releases and tags
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # NPM token for publishing packages
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
        run: npx auto shipit
        # Continue on error to prevent workflow failures if release isn't needed
        # This can happen if there are no conventional commits that trigger a release
        continue-on-error: true
